# Claude Command: Describe

This command helps you create well-formatted change descriptions with conventional commit messages and emoji.

## Usage

To describe a change, just type:
```
/describe [REVSET]
```

Where `[REVSET]` is an optional jujutsu revision specification (defaults to `@` - the current working copy).

## What This Command Does

1. Performs a `jj diff` on the revision to understand what changes are being described
2. Analyzes the diff to determine if multiple distinct logical changes are present
3. If multiple distinct changes are detected, suggests splitting the change into multiple smaller changes
4. For each change (or the single change if not split), creates a description using emoji conventional commit format

### Splitting Changes

When changes need to be split, the command will guide you through a manual split process since `jj split -i` may not work in all environments:

1. Create a new empty commit: `jj new`
2. Use `jj squash --from @- <file_pattern>` to move specific files to the new commit
3. Describe each commit with appropriate conventional commit messages
4. Rebase commits as needed to maintain logical order

## Best Practices for Change Descriptions

- **Verify before describing**: Ensure code is linted, builds correctly, and documentation is updated
- **Atomic changes**: Each change should contain related modifications that serve a single purpose
- **Split large changes**: If changes touch multiple concerns, split them into separate changes
- **Conventional commit format**: Use the format `<type>: <description>` where type is one of:
  - `feat`: A new feature
  - `fix`: A bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc)
  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
  - `perf`: Performance improvements
  - `test`: Adding or fixing tests
  - `chore`: Changes to the build process, tools, etc.
- **Present tense, imperative mood**: Write commit messages as commands (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature")
- **Concise first line**: Keep the first line under 72 characters
- **Emoji**: Each commit type is paired with an appropriate emoji:
  - ✨ `feat`: New feature
  - 🐛 `fix`: Bug fix
  - 📝 `docs`: Documentation
  - 💄 `style`: Formatting/style
  - ♻️ `refactor`: Code refactoring

## Guidelines for Splitting Changes

When analyzing the diff, consider splitting changes based on these criteria:

1. **Different concerns**: Changes to unrelated parts of the codebase
2. **Different types of changes**: Mixing features, fixes, refactoring, etc.
3. **File patterns**: Changes to different types of files (e.g., source code vs documentation)
4. **Logical grouping**: Changes that would be easier to understand or review separately
5. **Size**: Very large changes that would be clearer if broken down

## Examples

Good commit messages:
- ✨ feat: add user authentication system
- 🐛 fix: resolve memory leak in rendering process
- 📝 docs: update API documentation with new endpoints
- ♻️ refactor: simplify error handling logic in parser
- 🚨 fix: resolve linter warnings in component files
- 🧑‍💻 chore: improve developer tooling setup process
- 👔 feat: implement business logic for transaction validation
- 🩹 fix: address minor styling inconsistency in header
- 🚑️ fix: patch critical security vulnerability in auth flow
- 🎨 style: reorganize component structure for better readability
- 🔥 fix: remove deprecated legacy code
- 🦺 feat: add input validation for user registration form
- 💚 fix: resolve failing CI pipeline tests
- 📈 feat: implement analytics tracking for user engagement
- 🔒️ fix: strengthen authentication password requirements
- ♿️ feat: improve form accessibility for screen readers

Example of splitting changes:
- First commit: ✨ feat: add new solc version type definitions
- Second commit: 📝 docs: update documentation for new solc versions
- Third commit: 🔧 chore: update package.json dependencies
- Fourth commit: 🏷️ feat: add type definitions for new API endpoints
- Fifth commit: 🧵 feat: improve concurrency handling in worker threads
- Sixth commit: 🚨 fix: resolve linting issues in new code
- Seventh commit: ✅ test: add unit tests for new solc version features
- Eighth commit: 🔒️ fix: update dependencies with security vulnerabilities

## Command Options

- `[REVSET]`: Optional jujutsu revision to describe (defaults to `@`)
  - Examples: `@`, `@-`, `x`, `main~2`, etc.
- `--no-verify`: Skip running the pre-describe checks (lint, build, generate:docs)

## Important Notes

- If these checks fail, you'll be asked if you want to proceed with the description anyway or fix the issues first
- The description will apply to the specified revision (or current change if no revset provided)
- The description message will be constructed based on the changes detected
- Before describing, the command will review the diff to identify if multiple changes would be more appropriate
- If suggesting multiple changes, it will help you split and describe the changes separately using manual split techniques
- Always reviews the change diff to ensure the description matches the changes
- If `jj split -i` fails in your environment, the command will use manual split workarounds
